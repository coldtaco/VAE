Model type: SVAE
inputsize: [[4, 4], [8, 8]]
inlayersize: [64, 32, 16]
latentsize: 4
outlayersize: ListWrapper([16, 32, 64])
outputsize: [[4, 4], [1, 1]]
fc_size: [64, 32, 1]
Model has 2 inputs, class 0 is where the second input is drawn from a normal distributionwith mean of the first input, class 1 is where it isnt. Proper implementation of SVAE with no outliers
